## üéØ Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a predictive model that forecasts student performance (final marks). The primary goal is to leverage data to understand the factors that correlate with academic success and build a reliable model for prediction. This tool can be valuable for educators, institutions, and students to identify potential challenges and provide timely support.

## Problem Statement

The main objective is to answer the question: "Can we accurately predict a student's final grade based on their study habits, past performance, and personal attributes?" This is a **regression task** where the model learns patterns from a labeled dataset to estimate a continuous value (the final mark).

## üíæ Dataset

The model was trained on the **[Name of Your Dataset, e.g., "Student Performance Data Set"]** from [Source of your data, e.g., "UCI Machine Learning Repository" or "a custom school survey"].

The dataset includes the following key features:
* `studytime`: Weekly study time
* `failures`: Number of past class failures
* `G1`: First period grade
* `G2`: Second period grade
* `absences`: Number of school absences
* `[Add other key features you used]`

**Target Variable:**
* `G3` / `final_mark`: The final grade (the value our model predicts).

You can find the dataset in the `/data` directory or download it from [Link to your dataset].

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

The project followed a standard data science workflow:

1.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Handled missing values using [Your method, e.g., "mean imputation"].
    * Encoded categorical features (like `sex`, `address`) using [Your method, e.g., "One-Hot Encoding"].
    * Scaled numerical features using [Your method, e.g., "StandardScaler"].

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Analyzed the distribution of the target variable (`final_mark`).
    * Visualized correlations between features and the target variable (e.g., "study time" showed a strong positive correlation).

3.  **Model Selection & Training:**
    * Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
    * Tested several algorithms, including [e.g., "Linear Regression", "Decision Tree", "Random Forest"].
    * The final model selected was **[Your Chosen Model, e.g., "Random Forest Regressor"]** due to its superior performance.
    * Hyperparameter tuning was performed using [Your method, e.g., "GridSearchCV"].

## üìà Model Performance

The final model was evaluated on the unseen test set, achieving the following results:

* **R-squared ($R^2$):** [Your R-squared Score, e.g., 0.88]
    * *This means the model can explain [e.g., 88%] of the variance in the student marks.*
* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** [Your MAE Score, e.g., 1.5 points]
    * *On average, the model's prediction is off by approximately [e.g., 1.5] marks.*
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** [Your RMSE Score, e.g., 2.1 points]

**Key Findings:**
* The most important features for predicting the final mark were: `[Feature 1, e.g., G2]`, `[Feature 2, e.g., studytime]`, and `[Feature 3, e.g., failures]`.
